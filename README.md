## 📌 Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to implement and evaluate multiple machine learning classification models on the **Adult Census Income Dataset**.  
The task is to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K per year based on demographic and employment attributes.

## 📂 Dataset Description [1 mark]
- **Dataset:** Adult Census Income (UCI Machine Learning Repository)  
- **Instances:** ~48,842  
- **Features:** 14 attributes (categorical + numerical)  
- **Target Variable:** `income` (binary: `<=50K` or `>50K`)  
- **Preprocessing Steps:**  
  - Missing values (`?`) replaced with `NaN` and dropped  
  - Label encoding applied to categorical features  
  - Train-test split (80/20)  
  - Standard scaling applied to numerical features

## 🔍 Observations [3 marks]
| ML Model Name       | Observation about model performance |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Logistic Regression | Performs well on linear relationships; interpretable but less powerful on complex data. |
| Decision Tree       | Easy to interpret; prone to overfitting; moderate accuracy. |
| kNN                 | Sensitive to scaling; slower with large datasets; moderate performance. |
| Naive Bayes         | Fast and simple; assumes feature independence; decent baseline. |
| Random Forest       | Strong performance; handles categorical + numerical features well; robust against overfitting. |
| XGBoost             | Best overall performance; powerful ensemble method; slightly higher computational cost. |
